# Nutzerstudie

## What to test?
- grid/no grid during interplanetary navigation
- vignette/no vignette during navigation close to surface
- automatic movement to bookmarks before/after?
- teleportation to bookmarks vs. navigation?
- no general Cybersickness causes, but compare before/after, whether measures are effective at reducing symptoms

## Metrics
- SSQ? (needs multiple sessions?)
- continuous evaluation every few minutes?
  - plot cybersickness over time?
