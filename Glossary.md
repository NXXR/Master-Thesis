### Cybersickness
Term to describe side effects from use of virtual environments.
Often mentioned in studies using a variety of technologies including flat screen displays and [HMDs](#head-mounted-display-hmd).
> See also: [VR sickness](#vr-sickness) 

### Head-mounted Display (HMD)
Display device worn on the head with one or two small displays.
Examples of head-mounted displays are modern VR headsets such as: Valve Index, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift.

### Motion Sickness
Motion Sickness occurs due to difference between actual and expected motion.
Main causes are:
- Motion that is felt but not seen (terrestrial motion sickness)
- Motion that is seen but not felt (space motion sickness)
- Motions felt and seen, that don't correspond to another

### Simulator Sickness
Term originating from early use of flight simulators in the military, and is still currently used in research using
 modern [HMD](#head-mounted-display-hmd) technology.
Simulator Sickness is a subset of [motion sickness](#motion-sickness) that is typically experienced by pilots who
 undergo training for extended periods of time in flight simulators.
Symptoms include discomfort, apathy, drowsiness, disorientation, fatigue, vomiting.

### Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)
Questionnaire intended for military personnel using flight simulators to asses simulation quality.
Scores between 10-15 indicate significant symptoms;
Scores between 15-20 are a concern;
Scores over 20 indicate a problem simulator.
Cut-off scores established from military personnel using flight simulators.
Scores may differ for general population and tend to be higher in virtual environments compared to military grade
 flight simulators.

### Vergence-Accommodation Conflict
Vergence refers to the way the eyes move laterally to adjust to items moving toward and away from the eyes combined
 with the process of focusing (accomodation).
These visual processes do not occur naturally in a stereoscopic display as accomodation occurs at a fixed screen depth.

### VR Sickness
Term typically used in studies using [HMDs](#head-mounted-display-hmd).
Occurs when exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms similar to [simulator-](#simulator-sickness) or [motion
 sickness](#motion-sickness).
While simulator sickness tends to be characterized by oculomotor disturbances, VR sickness is characterized by
 disorientation.
