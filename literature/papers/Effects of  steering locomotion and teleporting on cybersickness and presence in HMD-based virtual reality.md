# Effects of steering locomotion and teleporting on cybersickness and presence in HMD-based virtual reality
[source](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-019-00407-8)

- 25 participants
- "Red Fall" virtual environment in Nature Treks VR
- 16 min exposure

- steering locomotion more sickening on average
- 9 participants more severe sickness from teleporting

- participants sick from teleportation found to differ from participants sick from steering in their postural stability

- sickness severity and symptoms unaffected by participants standing or sitting
  - although enhanced presence when standing

- Cybersickness Symptoms increase with time in trial for both methods
  - presence increase with time in trial

- no clear advantage for teleporting over steering for reducing cybersickness
  - some evidence of benefits of steering locomotion for presence


## Popular Explanations of Cybersickness

- cybersickness in HMD-based VR likely multi-sensory in origin
  - sensory conflict most common explanation in literature
    - occurs when information from user's senses conflicts with either each other or with what is expected in given
     context
    - sensory conflict due to vection (illusion of self-motion) often argued to be prime cause of cybersickness
      - visual self-motion information conflicts with information from other senses (somatosensory system)
    - only two papers examining relationship between vection and cybersickness for HMD-based VR found no [[1]](#source-1)
     or negative [[2]](#source-2) correlation between them
  - postural instability theory popular alternative explanation
    - postural stability defined as "state in which uncontrolled movements of the perception and action systems are 
     minimized" [[3]](#source-3)
    - prolonged postural instability argued to cause motion sickness [[4]](#source-4)
      - experiences of motion sickness always preceded by increases in postural instability and persist until 
       stability is restored
      - people who are naturally unstable are more likely to become motion sick during provocative simulation


## Types of virtual locomotion and cybersickness

- virtual locomotion method must allow effective exploration and interaction with the virtual environment, while also
 generating minimal cybersickness
- teleportation (user indicate the desired destination and then is immediately transported to location)
  - less visual motion simulation, assumed to be less provocative for cybersickness
  - recent studies report teleportation to be more comfortable than steering locomotion
  - teleportation with animated transitions between locations more provocative than traditional
  - users can show difficulties adjusting to new surroundings after each teleportation, leading to disorientation
- steering locomotion (user initiates continuous simulated self-motion toward the desired destination)
  - typically induces compelling vection
  - generates large areas of visual motion simulation leading to more cybersickness provocation


## Types of Virtual Locomotion and Presence

- presence is one of the major benefits of HMD-based VR, effective virtual locomotion should promote a strong 
 experience of presence
- presence depends on:
  - degree to which the user perceives that they are actually in the virtual environment (place illusion)
  - degree to which the user perceives that what is happening is actually happening (plausibility illusion)
- lack of continuous visual motion simulation, and blinks in visual scene during teleportation might weaken presence
  - teleportation involves non-ecological displacement, and therefor might be perceived as less coherent, thereby 
   reducing plausibility illusion
- a number of other studies failed to find significant differences between the effects of steering locomotion and 
 teleporting on presence
  - most of those studies used simple virtual environments, therefore findings might not be representative of effects
   on presence in richer, more dynamic virtual environments


## Relationship Between Cybersickness and Presence

- evidence favours a negative relationship between presence and cybersickness (feeling of presence decreases as 
 cybersickness increases)
  - past studies also reported positive, negative, and neutral relationships between presence and cybersickness


## The Current Study

### Goals

- trying to identify an effective method of virtual locomotion to explore large simulated environments, maximizing 
 presence while mitigating the likelihood of cybersickness

### Setup

- participants had to continuously navigate through a large simulated natural outdoor scene by teleportation or 
steering locomotion
- participants performed both tasks in different trials once while seated, and while free-standing
- measuring each participants' postural stability before each exposure to VR


#### Design

- 2 Control Types x 2 Posture Type x 6 Time in Trial
- tested over 2 days, 2 trials each day, separated by at least 24 h to allow cybersickness symptoms to subside
- Additional dependent variables:
  - history of gaming
  - spontaneous postural instability before VR exposure
  - cybersickness symptoms before, during, and directly after VR exposure
  - feelings of presence during and directly after VR exposure
  - overall experience of vection


#### Participants

- 25 adult participants (12 F, 13 M)
- 18 - 47 yrs old (M = 23.92; SD = 5.25)
- recruited online from general population
- all with normal or corrcted-to-normal vision, with no self-reportd visual, vestibular or neurological impairments
- only 2 of the female participants reported playing videogames regularly, compared to 10 of our male participants
- participants' age, sex, height, video game usage, and previous VR experience were recorded


#### Methods of Virtual Locomotion

- Steering:
  - user points with their hand in the desired direction
  - while pressing the trigger, the user is simulated walking in the pointing direction
- Teleporting:
  - user can press the trigger and aim at a target in the distance, once released, their point of view immediately 
   changes to that location


### Predictions

- cybersickness will be greater during steering locomotion than during teleporting
- a positive relationship between cybersickness and vection
- test predictions by measuring participants' vection strength ratings following each VR-session, as well as their 
 cybersickness ratings
- according to postural instability theory, participants more naturally unstable will be more likely to experience 
cybersickness, therefore those participants may prefer teleporting over steering locomotion
- participants less likely to become cybersick when seated as opposed to standing (postural stability theory)
- based on previous findings, females may be more prone to cybersickness symptoms than men
- steering locomotion should induce greater presence than teleporting
- simulated movements occur from a standing eye-height, therefore being seated is expected to be perceived as less 
plausible during virtual locomotion


### Measuring Cybersickness and Vection Strength

- Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) directly before and after each exposure
- Fast Motion Sickness Scale (FMS) assessed every 3 min during exposure
- 10 point scale measuring vection strength (0, no vection/felt stationary, to 10, strong, compelling vection)
- 14-item Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) after each exposure to measure presence
- 10 point scale measuring presence assessed every 3 min during exposure
