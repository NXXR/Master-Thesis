# Factors Associated With Virtual Reality Sickness in Head-Mounted Displays: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
*[Source](Factors Associated With Virtual Reality Sickness in Head-Mounted Displays A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.bak.pdf)*

## Participants data and questionnaire results
- Meta Analysis participants: 3016
  - 19.5-80 mean age range
    - categorized into x >= 35 > y
    - (vestibular function involved in **sensory conflict theory** declines at age 40)
    - (altered postural balance involved in **postural instability theory** commences at age 30-39)
  - 41% female
- Separation of VR content into 4 types:
  - 360° videos: captured video or images allowing a 360° view of a virtual environment
  - gaming: highly detailed content with active interaction (off-the-shelf games and researcher developed content)
  - minimalist: basic shapes or minimal textures with simple interactions
  - scenic: detailed environments with no or simple interaction

| Content    | Detail | Interaction | Sensory Feedback | Total Mean SSQ Score |
|------------|--------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 360° video | High   | Passive     | Low              | 27.42                |
| Gaming     | High   | Active      | High             | **34.26**            |
| Minimalist | Low    | Active      | Low (usually)    | 21.71                |
| Scenic     | High   | Passive     | Low              | 17.33                |

- Differentiating between 3 types of locomotion:
  - stationary
  - controller-based movement
    - flying
    - controller-based walking
    - teleporting
    - driving
  - walking
    - walking (in roomscale spaces)
    - walking in place
    - walking on a treadmill

- Time categorization into:
  - < 10 min
  - \>= 10 min
  - \>= 20 min

## Findings and conclusions
- VR Sickness not only influenced by resolution & refresh rate but also content type
- advances in HMD technology (field of view, resolution, framerate, ergonomic factors) increased levels of immersion
 and realism, influencing the occurrence of VR sickness
  - clear images and accurate tracking of movement may lead to fewer sensory conflicts and a reduction in VR sickness
   symptoms
- increase in field of view may also increase risk of VR sickness
- content consisting of low amounts of motion may be less likely to induce VR sickness
- length of time exposed to virtual environment may influence likelihood and severity of VR sickness
  - another review found some people may build up a resistance or adapt over time, especially over multiple sessions
- physically walking has been found to reduce the incidence of VR sickness compared to controller-based navigation
- sickness in virtual environments increases after 10 min in HMDs and simulator studies
- highest pooled SSQ subscale scores for:
  1. disorientation (*M* = 23.50)
  2. oculomotor (*M* = 17.09)
  3. nausea (*M* = 16.72)
  - distribution demonstrates difference with symptom profile of motion sickness, where the ranking is typically
   reversed
- [vergence-accomodation conflict](../../Glossary.md#vergence-accommodation-conflict) in content with high visual
 stimulation may be the reason for higher SSQ scores in the oculomotor subscale as there are more changes in the
 stimulus distance compared to other content
- rapid changes in stimulus distance increase visual discomfort
- new, high-quality stereoscopic HMDs are capable of simulating the visual and spacial properties, but still fall
 short in replicating how humans see and perceive depth under natural viewing conditions
- locomotion type significantly influences SSQ scores
  - controller-based movement has highest total SSQ mean (*M* = 32.55)
  - nausea and oculomoteor subscale scores higher when stationary as opposed to controller-based moving or walking
  - difference between total scores and subscales may result from certain methods of locomotion having a greater
   impact on specific symptoms depending on type (e.g. being stationary causes a higher conflict in virtual
   environments where there is movement and thus lead to an increase of nausea symptoms)
    - other research also indicates a reduction in symptoms when user initiated movement is matched to the environment
- nausea and disorientation subscale scores were lower in studies with exposure times of <10 min compared to >=10 min
  - exposure times of >=20 min had lower scores than exposure times >=10, which may suggest some sort of accommodation
  - but exposure times of >=10 min also had the highest percentage of gaming content (62%), while the longest
   exposure times were using minimalist or scenic content

## Problems with current studies
- inconsistent terminology for sickness from using virtual environments, often used interchangeably
- "Virtual Reality Symptom Questionnaire" and "Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire" not yet widely adopted and
 lacking sufficient data/studies to warrant meta-analysis
- 35% of papers in this analysis used older HMDs, which differ fundamentally from more modern HMDs (recent 5 years),
 therefor the occurrence of symptoms with the use of currently available HMDs is hard to predict

## Reasons for research
- identifying factors that increase the occurrence of simulator sickness necessary with increased usage of VR  for
 rehabilitation, industry training, and gaming/entertainment
-focus on content, amount of visual stimulation (motion of virtual environment), whether a person is stationary or
 moving in the virtual environment and time as possible factors for VR sickness and severity of symptoms
