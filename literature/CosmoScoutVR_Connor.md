# CosmoScoutVR: A Case Study of Navigational Techniques for Cybersickness Reduction
*[Source](CosmoScoutVR_Connor.pdf)*

- No significant differences between tested navigation techniques
- Cybersickness caused by conflict between visual cortex and vestibular system
- typical movements in the physical world can induce nausea, headache, eye strain, and in extreme cases vomiting
- effect exacerbated when there are high levels of visual detail

Tested movement techniques:
1. Teleportation
    - instantaneous repositioning is believed to result in little to no Cybersickness
2. Semi-automatic navigation
    - allows developers to create structure around navigation, while still allowing the user a sense of control over
     their orientation
3. 2-degrees-of-freedom trackpad navigation
    - smooth & continuous control over orientation
    - greater sense of presence resulting in less cybersickness
4. dynamic Field-of-View manipulation
    - shrinking FOV when moving, decreasing peripheral visual information

Study:
- 15 participants (14 male, 1 female)
    - 6 w/ glasses
    - minimal previous experiences with VR

- participants maneuver through a virtual environment using the different navigation techniques
- seated in a swivel chair
- 60 seconds per navigation technique to collect randomly positioned cubes on a planet within the simulation

Conclusion:
- Cybersickness should be considered highly nuanced with multiple sources and influences
    - other sources may be:
        - realism
        - visual detail
        - presence
        - uncanny valley effect
- downgrading level of realism may avoid Cybersickness but impedes sense of presence
-presence necessary to minimize visual and vestibular gap that evokes Cybersickness
