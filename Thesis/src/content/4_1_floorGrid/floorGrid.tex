\section{Floor Grid}\label{sec:floor-grid}

In concordance with the studies examined in section~\ref{subsec:stable-reference-frame}, we decided to add a stable
reference frame to help with postural stability, especially focused on the 6-Degrees-of-Freedom free navigation in
the interplanetary areas of the Simulation, that generally lack any sort of fixed reference frame.
The Floor grid aims to provide a definitive up-direction that coincides with the real world's gravity, thereby
improving postural stability and minimizing sensory conflicts.
While superimposing a grid on the floor may significantly reduce the feeling of presence, we accept this effect since
the primary function of CosmoScout VR as a scientific visualization tool is not as dependent on an immersive feeling
as entertainment oriented simulations may be.
Additionally, we also suspect that small changes to the control scheme can be added to further change the interaction
context from an egocentric view within the simulation to a more exocentric "Pseudo AR" approach, where the user
manipulates the surrounding simulation without moving, similar to the Worlds-in-Miniature approach proposed
by Drogemuller et al.~\cite{Drogemuller2020}.
The Hypothesis is that a "Pseudo AR" simulation environment would drastically reduce cybersickness symptoms, as the
sensory conflict between the user inside the simulation and the real world is minimal, and postural stability should
be easier for the user.
