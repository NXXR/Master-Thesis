1. ### Virtual Reality ###
   
    - interactive, immersive, realistic, 3D computer simulated world around the user
    - able to generate compelling feelings of presence -> immersive VR distinguished from other forms of media
        - user interface as a synthetic world, the user can interact with and navigate as if they were in the 
          real world [Davis2014]
        - immerse a person in an environment that allows natural interaction and participation in order to 
          perform tasks
    - virtual environments were described as early as 1965 by Ivan E. Sutherland
        - also created what is widely believed to be the first head-mounted display [Sutherland1968]
    - continuous effort to improve tools for inspecting and interacting w/ virtual environments over the last 50 
      yrs [Weech2019]
        - increased recent emergence through improved position tracking (Wii/Kinect/etc.)
    - various devices and technologies to experience virtual reality
        - Computer Automatic/Aided Virtual Environment (CAVE), multiple projected images in a room, viewed through 
          stereoscopic glasses
        - Head-mounted Displays (HMDs) recently more affordable, consumer-friendly
            - widespread interest from media and general population
    - spectrum of Virtual Environments [Milgram]
        
    - Stereoscopic display the main feature of VR tech
        - providing left and right eye with offset views imitating real world stereoscopic view
        - different methods to achieve this:
            - passive, polarizing filters to ensure each eye only sees the intended images
            - active, "shutter-glasses" turning lenses opaque using a timing signal to ensure each eye only sees 
              the intended images
            - dedicated displays for each eye
    - VR providing a new style of (intuitive) human-computer interface, with the primary goal to increase 
      communication bandwidth between human and computer [Davis2014]
    - VR to train individuals in tasks too difficult, dangerous, or expensive to be conducted in the real world
    - VR in medical treatments to treat anxiety disorders (phobias & PTSD) [Clifton2019]
    - utilized in different domains for visualisation and intuitive interfaces
        - healthcare, construction, architecture
