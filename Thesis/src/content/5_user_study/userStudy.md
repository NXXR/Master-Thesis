5. ## User Study ##

- determining effectiveness of mitigation techniques difficult
- no general study into cybersickness
    - goal of this study is not cybersickness itself
    - improvement/mitigation of navigation in CosmoScout VR
- objective measures inaccessible or difficult to implement
    - physiological measurements require special equipment
    - balance board for CoG require breaks in exposure for the testing
    - head dispersion using HMD IMU possible but require programming an interface to access sensor data
        - best results also require breaks in exposure for the testing
- subjective measures easier to administer
    - SSQ not suited for HMD VR
    - FMS quick & easy data acquisition

    1. ### User Study Concept ###
        - within subject study
        - mitigation techniques aimed at different scenarios and aspects of the simulation
        - separation of mitigation and navigation improvements into scenarios
        - training phase to get used to control scheme
            - test subject's familiarity w/ control / intuitiveness
            - same as scenarios move between cp
        - navigation scenarios for free movement in space (grid) and on surface (vignette)
            - test each scenario w/ and w/o mitigation method
                - user moves thru simulation
                    - render next cp in simulation (~10 -> 5~10 min)
                - counterbalance scenarios
                - relative "worsening"
            - query FMS every min during navigation either verbal or interface plugin
                - ~~verbal query -> less development cost, only verbal interruption of subject~~
                - interface query -> easy recording, subject more immediate answer (no verbalization), but potential 
                  interruption of task
                - interface query w/ analog slider -> measure rising fronts?
            - head dispersion / CoG measurements not during navigation -> roomscale simulation restricting user 
              movement may influence perception
                - measurements in between tasks possible -> but useful?
            - in addition to FMS, freeform interview feedback on method & comparison between w/ & w/o
                - [questions]
        - automatic navigation scenarios test new navigation
            - FMS and verbal feedback after multiple movements
