- 30-80% likelihood to show sickness symptoms [[16](#16)]
- Cybersickness occurs during or after exposure to virtual environments [[6](#6)]
- symptoms like eye strain, headache, pallor, sweating, disorientation, vertigo, nausea, in extreme cases vomiting [
  [6](#6)]
- severity increases with longer exposure [[8](#8),[9](#9),[10](#10)]
- overall sickness reduces with repeated exposure [[11](#11)]

- Simulator Sickness; originated from assessment of military flight simulators [[1](#1),[2](#2)]
- Cybersickness; originally used to describe side effects form use of virtual environments [[1](#1)[3](#3)]
- VR Sickness; typically used in studies involving HMDs [[4](#4),[5](#5)]
- different sickness profiles; for cybersickness, disorientation symptoms rank highest and oculomotor symptoms lowes
  (inverted for simulator sickness) [[7](#7)]
- unlike motion & simulator sickness, cybersickness/vr sickness can occur without stimulation to the vestibular system,
  while motion and simulator sickness can occur without visual stimulation [[6](#6)]
- cybersickness three times more severe than simulator sickness [[7](#7)]
- terminology used interchangeably across literature
- focus on HMD VR, most studies cybersickness ==> "VR Sickness", sometimes Cybersickness (may involve additional 
  peripheries)

    2. ### Common causes of VR sickness ###
        1. #### Sensory conflict theory ####
            - sensory systems mismatch between each other or system and expectation
            - sensory conflict due to vection (illusion of self movement while not moving) argued to be prime cause
              [[12](#12),[13](#13)]
                - recent studies show vection not to be main cause of sensory conflict sickness symptoms [[14](#14)]
            - vestibular system (motion & balance) receives no inputs, while the visual system is receiving 
              information about motion
            - car passengers get motion sickness, but driver does not, indicating low involvement causes more 
              sickness [[15](#15)]
            - Theory Popular because of a lot of data to back it up and wide exposure [[16](#16)]
            - criticised because theory cannot predict occurrence of cybersickness and can't explain individual 
              differences or causation of cybersickness [[6](#6)]

        2. #### Postural instability theory ####
            - instabilities in posture cause sickness, proposed by [[17](#17)]
            - postural instability can predict sickness unlike sensory conflict theory [[17](#17)]
            - motion sickness preceeded by postural sway [[17](#17)]
            - increases in range, velocity, variance, and frequency of postural sway signify increased motion 
              sickness [[6](#6),[17](#17)]
            - several studies support these findings and even suggest postural stability as an indicator for 
              general cybersickness in HMD-based VR [[18](#18),[19](#19),[20](#20)]
  
        3. #### Other theories ####
            1. ##### Rest frame theory #####
                - similar to postural instability
                - mismatch in sensed gravitation and perceived up-direction [[Rebenitsch2016](#16)]
                - studies found superimposing frames with horizontal lines [[Chang2013]] or a grid [[Duh2001]] help 
                  reduce sickness symptoms
                    - presumably improving postural stability by providing a fixed reference point/minimizing 
                      sensory conflict
                - more general explanation in instances where postural control may not be as much of a factor (e.g. 
                  when seated) [[Rebenitsch2016](#16)]
            2. ##### Vergence Accommodation conflict theory #####
                - Vergence refers to simultaneous lateral eye movement to adjust to objects moving towards or away from 
                  the individual [?[Cassin2006]? [Kim2014](#21)]
                - Accommodation is the process of adjusting the focal length to the perceived distance, focusing on the 
                  object
                - in virtual environments, especially in HMD VR systems, images are presented at the same distance
                - conflict with real life as eyes always focus on the same distance[[Rebenitsch2016](#16)]
                - v-a does not occur naturally in stereoscopic display [[Saredakis2020](#1)]
                - high level of visual stimulation and changes in stimulus distance produce more sickness [[Kim2014](#21)]
