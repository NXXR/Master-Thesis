2. ## Related Work / Background ##

- 30-80% likelihood to show sickness symptoms [[16](#16)]
- Cybersickness occurs during or after exposure to virtual environments [[6](#6)]
- symptoms like eye strain, headache, pallor, sweating, disorientation, vertigo, nausea, in extreme cases vomiting [
  [6](#6)]
- severity increases with longer exposure [[8](#8),[9](#9),[10](#10)]
- overall sickness reduces with repeated exposure [[11](#11)]

- Simulator Sickness; originated from assessment of military flight simulators [[1](#1),[2](#2)]
- Cybersickness; originally used to describe side effects form use of virtual environments [[1](#1)[3](#3)]
- VR Sickness; typically used in studies involving HMDs [[4](#4),[5](#5)]
- different sickness profiles; for cybersickness, disorientation symptoms rank highest and oculomotor symptoms lowes
  (inverted for simulator sickness) [[7](#7)]
- unlike motion & simulator sickness, cybersickness/vr sickness can occur without stimulation to the vestibular system,
  while motion and simulator sickness can occur without visual stimulation [[6](#6)]
- cybersickness three times more severe than simulator sickness [[7](#7)]
- terminology used interchangeably across literature
- focus on HMD VR, most studies cybersickness ==> "VR Sickness", sometimes Cybersickness (may involve additional 
  peripheries)

    2. ### Common causes of VR sickness ###
        1. #### Sensory conflict theory ####
            - sensory systems mismatch between each other or system and expectation
            - sensory conflict due to vection (illusion of self movement while not moving) argued to be prime cause
              [[12](#12),[13](#13)]
                - recent studies show vection not to be main cause of sensory conflict sickness symptoms [[14](#14)]
            - vestibular system (motion & balance) receives no inputs, while the visual system is receiving 
              information about motion
            - car passengers get motion sickness, but driver does not, indicating low involvement causes more 
              sickness [[15](#15)]
            - Theory Popular because of a lot of data to back it up and wide exposure [[16](#16)]
            - criticised because theory cannot predict occurrence of cybersickness and can't explain individual 
              differences or causation of cybersickness [[6](#6)]

        2. #### Postural instability theory ####
            - instabilities in posture cause sickness, proposed by [[17](#17)]
            - postural instability can predict sickness unlike sensory conflict theory [[17](#17)]
            - motion sickness preceeded by postural sway [[17](#17)]
            - increases in range, velocity, variance, and frequency of postural sway signify increased motion 
              sickness [[6](#6),[17](#17)]
            - several studies support these findings and even suggest postural stability as an indicator for 
              general cybersickness in HMD-based VR [[18](#18),[19](#19),[20](#20)]
  
        3. #### Other theories ####
            1. ##### Rest frame theory #####
                - similar to postural instability
                - mismatch in sensed gravitation and perceived up-direction [[Rebenitsch2016](#16)]
                - studies found superimposing frames with horizontal lines [[Chang2013]] or a grid [[Duh2001]] help 
                  reduce sickness symptoms
                    - presumably improving postural stability by providing a fixed reference point/minimizing 
                      sensory conflict
                - more general explanation in instances where postural control may not be as much of a factor (e.g. 
                  when seated) [[Rebenitsch2016](#16)]

            2. ##### Vergence Accommodation conflict theory #####
                - Vergence refers to simultaneous lateral eye movement to adjust to objects moving towards or away from 
                  the individual [?[Cassin2006]? [Kim2014](#21)]
                - Accommodation is the process of adjusting the focal length to the perceived distance, focusing on the 
                  object
                - in virtual environments, especially in HMD VR systems, images are presented at the same distance
                - conflict with real life as eyes always focus on the same distance[[Rebenitsch2016](#16)]
                - v-a does not occur naturally in stereoscopic display [[Saredakis2020](#1)]
                - high level of visual stimulation and changes in stimulus distance produce more sickness [[Kim2014](#21)]

    3. ### Methods of measurement ###
        - hard to measure objectively, because of symptom's variety, non-observable, and subjective [[McCauley1992](#3)]
        - symptoms can also occur after exposure, making measuring symptoms harder [[McCauley1992](#3)]
        - Questionnaires most popular -> easy and cheap, but yield subjective info
            - SSQ by [[Kennedy1993](#2)]
            - VRSQ by [[Ames2005]]
            - CSQ by [[Stone2017]]
            - MSAQ by [[Gianaros2001]]
            - FMS by [[Keshavarz2011]]
        - objective measurements

        1. #### Questionnaires ####
            1. ##### Simulator Sickness Questionnaire #####
                - one of the most commonly used Measurements in cybersickness [[Saredakis2020](#1)]
                - developed from Pensacola Motion Sickness Questionnaire (MSQ) to provide easier computer or manual 
                  scoring, and to better tailor Questionnaire for SS instead of MS [[Kennedy1993](#2)]
                - major objectives [[Kennedy1993](#2)]:
                    - provide a more valid index of overall simulator sickness severity as distinguished from motion 
                      sickness
                    - provide subscale scores that are more diagnostic of the locus od simulator sickness in a 
                      particular simulator
                    - provide a scoring approach to make monitoring and cumulative tracking relatively straightforward
                - separation of symptoms into 3 distinct clusters as mentioned above, Oculomotor, Disorientation, and 
                  Nausea [[Kennedy1993](#2)]
                - each (partially) independent cluster used as basis for a subscale [[Kennedy1993](#2)]
                    - each subscale reflecting the impact of simulator exposure on a different "target system"
                      [[Kennedy1993](#2)]
                    - simplifies the process of determining where and in what ways a simulator may be causing problems
                      [[Kennedy1993](#2)]
                - scores symptoms on 4-point scale and use derived weights to sum to final score, interpretable by 
                  comparison to calibration group of simulators [[Kennedy1993](#2)]
                - [[Kennedy1993](#2)] offers further separation, but not as well defined: too few simulator-relevant 
                  symptoms to provide adequate reliability for a subscale score based on the additional factors
                    - split Oculomotor into disturbance of visual processing (blurred vision, difficulty focusing) and 
                      symptoms caused by disturbance (headache, eyestrain, fatigue)
                    - separation of "tired and hungry" factor (fatigue, difficulty concentrating) as artifact created by 
                      time spent in simulator
                    - split Nausea into premonitory signs (increased salivation, burping) and advanced stages (nausea, 
                      sweating)
                - modal position is no indicated symptomatology, and scale sensitivity at upper extremes of 
                  symptomatology range (0-value contains 40-75% of observations) [[Kennedy1993](#2)]
                - "scales do not distinguish among simulators that have no problems, but rather intended to discriminate 
                  problem simulators from those with no indicated difficulties."[[Kennedy1993](#2)]
                - complex structure and development process that involves a sample of highly trained professionals and 
                  simulator experiments, which do not comply with the modern day HMD based VR and entertainment oriented 
                  users, reasons for not using SSQ [[Sevinc2020](#22)]
                  
            2. ##### VRSQ [[Ames2005]] #####
                - developed specifically for cybersickness [[Ames2005]]
                - rearrange the SSQ symptoms for VR assessment [[Sevinc2020]]
                - [[Ames2005]] felt the SSQ does not address ocular symptoms for VR
                - separation into 2 clusters: general body symptoms and eye-related symptoms [[Ames2005]]
                - [[Ames2005]] collected 23 symptoms into 2 clusters: 12 non-ocular & 11 ocular
                - 7-option response scale (0-6): "none" (0), "slight" (1,2), "moderate" (3,4), and "severe" (5,6) [
                  [Ames2005]]
                - all participants completed the VRSQ immediately after the exposure, and then repeatedly at 2-min 
                  intervals for a total of 6 post-exposure VRSQ administrations [[Ames2005]]
                - [[Ames2005]] found 13 symptoms with high item-total correlations to remain part of the measurement
                - "nausea" did not meet the criteria, but was kept for researchers using more "dynamic imagery"
                - however, [[Ames2005]] used a video on a HMD without any user interaction or input method -> used 
                  visual motion stimulus like other studies instead of VR [[Stone2017]]
                - validity for cybersickness is questionable according to [[Sone2017]] because the stimulus was not 
                  VR, and [[Davis2014]] also argue this is the reason for the lack of published studies using the VRSQ
                
            3. ##### CSQ [[Stone2017]] #####
                - CyberSickness Questionnaire (CSQ)
                - alternative to SSQ to focus on cybersickness symptoms
                - reinterpreting SSQ results in cybersickness context
                - similar refinement approach to the SSQ from MSQ
                - identify symptoms clearly indicating sickness: headache, eyestrain, nausea, blurred vision, 
                  dizzy (eyes open), dizzy (eyes closed), vertigo, difficulty focusing, and fullness of head
                - combine "severe" and "moderate" responses
                - separation into two clusters: "Dizziness" and "Difficulty focusing"
                - CSQ allows using the SSQ with CSQ scoring:
                    - administer post-exposure SSQ
                    - remove not needed items
                    - combine "severe" and "moderate" responses
                    - compute both CSQ factors -> sum after multiplying item score by the factor loading in table 11

            4. ##### MSAQ [[Gianaros2001]] #####
                - motion sickness assessment questionnaire (MSAQ)
                - suggest assessment of motion sickness across broad range of contexts (similar to Penascola 
                  Diagnostic Index) [[Gianaros2001]]
                - also recognizes multi-dimensionality of mition sickness symptoms [[Gianaros2001]]
                - "current" questionnaires don't accurately assess sopite syndrome
                    - sopite-related symptoms include drowsiness, yawning, and disengagement from the environment
                      [[Graybiel1976]]
                - [[Gianaros2001]] identify four-factor solution: gastrointestinal, central, peripheral, and 
                  sopite-related dimensions of motion sickness
                    - gastrointernal: sickness, queasy, nausea
                    - central: dizziness, disorientation, lightheadedness, blurred vision
                    - peripheral: being sweaty, clammy/cold sweat, hot
                    - sopite: being annoyed, tired, fatigue, uneasy
                - may be used for measuring both overall (total scores) and distinct dimensions (subscale scores) of 
                  motion sickness [[Gianaros2001]]
                - generated symptoms may stem from relatively narrow range of contexts => questionnaire may need to 
                  be modified to accurately reflect multiple dimensions of MS across different motion environments
                  [[Gianaros2001]]
                - development process based on visually-induced motion sickness (non-vr), but successfully employed 
                  in simulator and VR studies [[Sevinc2020]]
                - symptom items generated independently by non-experts => valid descriptors of motion sickness in a 
                  general population [[Gianaros2001]]
                 
            5. ##### Single-Item (FMS) [[Keshavarz2011]] #####
                - Fast Motion Sickness Scale (FMS)
                - most popular of many single-item questionnaires
                - traditional questionnaires cannot be administered during stimulus presentation [[Keshavarz2011]]
                - continuous and simple polling of MS data during presentation [[Keshavarz2011]]
                - measures 2 cardinal symptoms of MS: nausea & general discomfort [[Keshavarz2011]]
                - verbal ratings on 20-point scale 0 (no sickness) to 20 (frank sickness) , 1 rating per minute
                  [[Keshavarz2011]]
                - 20-point scale to be able to differentiate among lower degrees of MS & capture different states of 
                  well-being as well as states of sickness [[Keshavarz2011]]
                    - participants able to express feelings more precisely [[Keshavarz2011]]
                - indifferent to physiological correlates or causes of MS [[Keshavarz2011]]
                    - participants unable to differentiate between nausea and other precursors [[Keshavarz2011]]
                - only designed to quantify subjective aspects of nausea and general discomfort im MS [[Keshavarz2011]]
                - shows high correlations to SSQ total score & Nausea Subscale [[Keshavarz2011]]
                - [[Rebenitsch2016]] concludes one-point rating scales are acceptable to monitor symptoms, but not 
                  as thorough or sensitive

        2. #### Objective measurements ####
            - ##### physiological measurements [[Kim2005]] #####
                - potential to monitor symptoms without interrupting the vr exposure [[Rebenitsch2016]]
                - combination of subjective and objective measures may offer better evaluation of motion sickness
                - objective measures more precise
                - tested different electrophysiological signals before, during, and after exposure
                - collected signals that showed significant corellation in previous studies
                    - heart period
                    - respiratory sinus arrhythmia
                    - respiration rate
                    - eyeblink rate
                    - fingertip pulse volume
                    - fingertip temperature
                    - skin conductance
                    - gastric tachyarrhythmia
                    - electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum
                - 45 of 57 subjects reported cybersickness during exposure
                - cybersickness (SSQ) scores significant positive correlation with gastric tachyarrhythmia, eyeblink 
                  rate, respiration rate, respiration sinus arrhythmia, and heart period
                - the greater subject's change from baseline, the more they reported cybersickness symptoms
                - gastric tachyarrhythmia, skin conductance, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and relative delta power 
                  fo F3 and T3 were significantly greater than baseline
                - Heart period, fingertip skin temperature, photoplethysmogram maximum amplitude, and relative beta 
                  power of F3 and T3 were significantly decreased compared to the baseline
                - due to the correlation of tachyarrhythmia and cybersickness, [[Kim2005]] suggest the autonomic 
                  nervous system may play a part in ocurrence of cybersickness
                - [[Roberts2005]] also found tachyarrhythmia (EGG) to be a strong indicator of exposure to VR
                - electrocardiogramm (ECG) and blood pressure showed best results for [[Kiryu2007], [Watanabe2008]], as 
                  the heart beat becomes stronger and/or the blood flow shows lower turbulence during exposure to 
                  virtual environments
                
            - ##### head dispersion [[Lim2020]] #####
                - physiological measures require costly hardware and are harder to analyze [[Davis2015]]
                - differences in postural sway as objective indicators of cybersickness symptoms
                - postural stability measurements offer an objective and fairly low cost method of measurement, and 
                  theoretically continuous symptom levels that do not require disturbance of the participant through 
                  frequent polling [[Rebenitsch2016]]
                    - [[Rebenitsch2016]] note postural sway measurements in practice are neither continuous, nor 
                      without disturbance, as the measurements require a specific standardized stance 
                - several studies measure amplitude, magnitude, and frequency of postural sway to predict 
                  cybersickness [[Riccio], [Stoffregen]]
                - older studies used to measure time till failure and stance breaks (explain) [[Rebenitsch2016]]
                - [[Villard2008]] and [[Dong2010], [Dong2011]] noticed subject that did not experience significant 
                  sickness symptoms had an increased standard deviation of motion during vr exposure, while subjects 
                  that experienced sickness symptoms showed greater variability with smaller average motion
                    - some studies mention subjects may self-adapt to virtual reality by consciously avoiding head 
                      movements when experiencing sickness symptoms [[Rebenitsch2016]]
                - [[Chardonnet2015]] proposed to measure VR sickness based on changes in CoG and found consistent 
                  results and high correlation with sickness scores
                - [[Lim2020]] proposed using the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) of a VR device to measure head 
                  dispersion and positively tested its correlation to CoG sway area
                    - no additional device or synchronization processing needed
      
    4. ### Different Methods of Mitigation ###
        - best practices [[McCauley1992]]:
            - "Exposure time should be limited until adaptation to the VE has occurred"
            - "Tasks that require high rates of linear or rotational acceleration should be avoided, or kept brief, 
              until the individual has fully adapted to the altered environment"
            - "Users of VEs should be considered on an individual basis when determining an adaptation program"
            - "self-movement through a Ve should be at high altitudes above the terrain and/or at lower speeds"
            - "unusual and extraordinary maneuvers (as these) should be avoided in VEs"
            - users of VE systems should be informed of the possible adverse effects including motion sickness, 
              perceptual aftereffects, decreased postural stability, and, in rare cases, delayed onset of symptoms"
            - "users should be advised to allow for recovery time after cybertravel before actively engaging in 
              potentially dangerous activities in the real world, such as driving an automobile"

        1. #### FoV limitation ####
            - [[Duh2001]] found that vection is strongly tied to FoV, as subjects receive information about vection 
              from their peripheral visual field
            - wide FoVs cause greater self-motion perception and postural disturbance [[Duh2001]]
            - strategically / automatically manipulating FoV can reduce degree of VR sickness experienced and help 
              adapt to VR [[Fernandes2016]]
            - participants in [[Lim2020]]'s study reported less noticable black regions until 60° FoV
            - [[Lim2020]] also showed that FoV limitation should be individual specific, as users react differently 
              to varying degrees of FoV limitation, or differences between dynamic FoV processing and fixed FoV
            - [[Lim2020]] conclude dynamic FoV processing can show a decrease of up to 37.05% in VR sickness symptoms
        2. #### Stable reference frames ####
