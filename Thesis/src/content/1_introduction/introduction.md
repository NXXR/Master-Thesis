1. ## Introduction ##
    1. ### Motivation ###
        Recent advances, and public interest in motion tracking technology (Wii\textcopyright,
        Kinect\textcopyright), as well as stereoscopic 3D media and technology have renewed the
        development in virtual and mixed reality technology.
        However, while hardware limitations have advanced, cybersickness is still seen as one of
        the main detractors to the widespread adoption of virtual reality
        technology~\cite{Rebenitsch2016}.

        Cybersickness is a form of motion sickness, with symptoms similar to simulator or sea
        sickness, that is encountered when experiencing a virtual environment.
        Similar to other forms of motion sickness, cybersickness is polysymptomatic and
        polygenic.
        Polysymptomatic means cybersickness can manifest in a wide range of different symptoms
        and severity, including nauseagenic symptoms like dryness of mouth or nausea, oculomotor
        symptoms like eye strain or headache, and disorientation symptoms like vertigo or
        dizziness.
        Polygenic means symptoms of cybersickness manifest differently for each individual,
        increasing the difficulty of comparing cybersickness incidence and severity across
        groups of users.

    2. ### Scope and Goal ###
        The goal of this thesis is the development of features that prevent and reduce
        cybersickness for users of the CosmoScout VR application.
        CosmoScout VR is a modular, scientific visualisation of the solar system that allows
        immersive, exploratory research on large, multiscale datasets.
        In the application, the free and automatic navigation have caused users to experience
        symptoms of cybersickness and are therefore the targets of the features developed in
        this thesis.
        Due to the different aspects of cybersickness and the different presumed origins of
        symptoms in the simulation, several independent features are developed to combat
        selected aspects of the virtual environment.
        The main separation is the free movement and the automatic navigation.
