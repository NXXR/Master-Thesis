# Motion Sickness Reduction for Solar System Exploration in VR

The successful candidate will work on visualization approaches to reduce motion sickness while exploring planets and
 the entire solar system.
The work will be based on a multi-scale solar system visualization system offering high-resolution data from street
 view to planet perspective to solar system navigation in virtual environments.
Right now, the user can navigate freely through space which creates motion sickness for the users and even more for
 attending colleagues.
The goal of the internship is to investigate methods to reduce motion sickness in virtual environments.
Additionally, useful approaches for navigation on different scales should be evaluated.
This might include restriction of degrees of freedom as well as autonomous flight trajectories from A to B.
The next task is to implement visual means to reduce motion sickness e.g. by adding visual anchors.

Requirements: Computer Science background, proficient C++ experiences, good OpenGL / Computer Graphics knowledge
, some Linux knowledge, Virtual Reality skills would be an asset.
